# Info
This class was an introductory course to computer science using Python. I took the course in Fall 2023 and TA'd in Fall 2024 and Fall 2025. This repository includes the assignments produced in the course, which can be run guided by each directory's README file. ~30 labs were excluded from this repository due to the simplicity of their functions.

# Final Project
**Alien Invaders** is a Space Invaders clone with an instructor-provided system for entity/window creation. Classes, objects, and game functionality were coded. My work is contained within the first set of files in the directory A7.
